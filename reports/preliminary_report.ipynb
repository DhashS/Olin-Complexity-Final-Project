    "### Abstract:\n",
    "This report is intended to answer the question: \"How much computation do you need to be to solve a TSP?\"\n",
    "Several algorithims exist for solving TSP and it's equivalence. Given a dataset, how close do we come to the optimal tour given several approaches. In this, I'll use several solvers, ranging from the simple, locally greedy algorithm, up to PTAS's that achieve  $O(n^{(log n)O(c)}), \\epsilon = 1 + \\frac{1}{c}$ where $c& is user defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to write or re-implement the algorithims, relying heavily on the primitives exposed by `networkx`\n",
    "\n",
    "My ending figure of merit is a scatter plot of compute required vs distance from optimal, to compare and contrast several approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiments:\n",
    "WIP\n",
    "#### Locally optimal greedy algorithm\n",
    "This works by picking a starting node $N$, and choosing the node corresponding to the lowest edge weight that is adjacent to it, if it has not already been visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is provided in `code/simple_greed.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../code/img/Simple greedy algorithm performance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal tour for this graph is of length **2579**, so this is terrible performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to run all greedy paths for a fully connected graph with 280 nodes (`data/a280.tsp`) takes `8.5s` to run, meaning that any individual tour takes, on average, `30.36ms`. \n",
